Analyze A/B test results:e-commerce website


The project used Python3 and Jupyter notebook 
The goal of this project is to help the company decide whether to go with the new e-commerce page, or to stay with the old one, or to run the experiment longer to make their decision.
  
The project is divided in 3 parts: 

1 - probabilities : in this part I explored the dataset in order to know more about it
 - the size, 
 - the number of unique users, 
 - the number of missing values, 
 - the number of duplicate users if any, 
 - the probability of users converting from old to new page,
 - the fairness of the system,
 and some interesting probabilities about the data.


2- A/B testing: in this part, I compared the 2 versions of the web pages in order to figure out which one is doing better. 
I started by setting the hypothesis, and then by running the A/B tests on samples of the data. And then interpreting the results.


3- Regression Approach: this part was another way to achieve the A/B results and this by using the logistic regression. The results are similar to the part 2. Variables were added at the end to see their effect on the conversion.
